# qtSimpleSTD
As the title clearly says, this is just a very simple and straightforward Qt GUI program to compute the mean value, variance, and standard deviation (STD) of two given numbers. The GUI part was simply created using Qt creator. It takes two input of a numerical value and outputs some computed numerical values represent the mean, variance, and standard deviation values, respectively. The calculation of these values begins when the "Calculate" button is pressed once the "1st number" and "2nd number" are entered. Pressing the "Quit" button will gracefully terminate the program.
